title: "I care about Rockport's future."
---


My name is Bill Wagner.
I've lived in Rockport for ten years just south of Pigeon Cove.
I am running for a position on the Board of Selectman in the upcoming 2020 Rockport town election.

I'm asking you to vote for me because:

* I am experienced in Town operations – 6 years on the Finance and 
  Capital Planning Committees has given me a deep knowledge of town operations and future financial challenges.

* I am dedicated to serving the resident’s interests: 
  improving Town roads, buildings and waterfront infrastructures. 
  Planning for the future of the Long Beach community and beach.

* I am committed to building a strong collaboration among the Selectmen, 
  volunteer committees and Town employeees to overcome these challenges, 
  and to ensure that Rockport is a vibrant community serving people of all ages.

Please don't hesitate to email me at `wrwagner@alum.mit.edu`.
I want to understand the issues you care about most.
